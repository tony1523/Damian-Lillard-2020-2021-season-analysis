# Introduction

I am a big Damian Lillard fan. Lillard is NBA basketball player for the Portland Trail Blazers who has won several awards during his career. 
He is considered one of the best players in the league today. For this reason, I thought it would be a great idea to do some analysis on one of his NBA seasons. 
I chose to analyse his 2020-2021 season as I followed it closely.
This project's goal is to desmontrate the different factors that effected Lillard's performance during that season. In order to do so, I will use the following notions: scraping data, cleaning data, graphing data, and forming stories from data. 
The data used in this project is from [basketball reference website](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01/gamelog/2021).

# Project Breakdown
The project was broken into five parts, each described as below: 

**1. Fetching the data:** I created a [python script](https://github.com/tony1523/Damian-Lillard-2020-2021-season-analysis/blob/main/nba_stats_scrapping.py) that allows me to fetch data from Lillard's 2020-2021
 season from the [basketball reference website](https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/l/lillada01/gamelog/2021), and export it to a CSV file.
 
**2. Cleaning and Formating the data:** Once I got the data into a [CSV file](https://github.com/tony1523/Damian-Lillard-2020-2021-season-analysis/blob/main/data/lillard_2021_stats.csv). 
I made sure to remove all duplicates and unrequired data, fixed errors, handled missing values and empty fields, and formated the data with the pandas library in python.
 
**3. Data Analysis:** After cleaning the data, I inspected it, explored it and made sure to understand it, in order 
to be able to build a story. 

**4. Interpret the findings:** I retained the most interesting findings, and interpreted the data.
